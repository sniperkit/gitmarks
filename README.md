**What is gitmarks?**

Gitmarks is a json based format to store bookmarks on Github.

**Why gitmarks?**

This is the cheapest way not only to backup your bookmarks but to make them searchable as well.

The basic idea is to utilise [github search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/) for browsing your bookmarks.

You can search in bookmarks folder or you can search in tags folder.

Or you can search both.

Tags folder is structured very much like inverted index for pages.
